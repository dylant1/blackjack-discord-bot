#TODO:

1. Add dashboard on the command "/blackjack"

   - Buttons to play game
   - Allow people to click a button to join
   - THIS DASHBOARD SHOULD HOPEFULLY BE PERESISTANT, MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE THOUGH

2. Add money balances on the command "/balances"

   - Gets all users in server and displays balance
   - When the bot enters the server everyone receives x coins

3. Command Ideas:

   - "/bet" (To join)
   - "/basic" (Displays basic strategy spreadsheet)
   - "/hit"
   - "/stand"
   - "/double"
   - "/insurance"
   - "/split"
